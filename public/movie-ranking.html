<h3>1. Alexa and Katie</h3>
<p> I absoutely love this series its about how two bestfriends (more like sisters) were there for 
    each other through the toughest moments of their lives  </p>
<h3> 2. The good witch</h3>
<p> This is also a series about a mother and daughter pair who also happen to be witches living in a 
    modern world
</p>
<h3> 3. The princess diaries 1 & 2 </h3>
<p> In real love with these films , a young 21st century girl with lots of problems is told that 
    she is a princess and how she has to take on the throne
